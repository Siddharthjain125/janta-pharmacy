# Mobile Application

> **Status:** Intentionally Deferred

---

## Why Deferred?

Mobile development is **explicitly deferred** until:
1. Web application validates core flows
2. Mobile-specific requirements are identified
3. Framework decision is made

**Philosophy:** Web-first validation before expanding platforms.

---

## Future Scope

When implemented, this directory will contain the mobile application (React Native, Flutter, or native).

---

## Current Access

Users can access the platform via web browser at http://localhost:3000.
